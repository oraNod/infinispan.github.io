I"–<p>Infinispan turbocharges applications by storing data closer to processing logic, which reduces latency and increases throughput.</p>

<p>Available as a Java library, you simply add Infinispan to your application dependencies and then youâ€™re ready to store data in the same memory space as the executing code.</p>

<p>If you want to provision a data layer that is independent of your applications, you can use Infinispan Server for remote access to data with in-memory performance. Clients are a single network hop away from data through consistent hashing techniques and can make requests over HTTP or with a custom binary TCP protocol called Hot Rod.</p>
